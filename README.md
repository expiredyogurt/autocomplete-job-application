# Autocomplete Job Application

This Tampermonkey script automates the job application flow on [Site Name] using browser-native JavaScript.  
It identifies buttons by exact text and clicks through the full "Quick Apply" cycle, including:

- Skipping the cover letter
- Looping through "Continue" steps
- Submitting the final application

## Why I Built This

I wanted to explore lightweight browser automation using Tampermonkey.  
This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Inspect and target DOM elements reliably
- Chain multi-step workflows with fallback logic
- Build modular, branded tools for personal use

## How It Works

The script runs on matching pages and adds a floating Play/Stop button.  
Once activated, it scrolls to and clicks each step in the application flow, highlighting buttons as it goes.

## Skills Demonstrated

- JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Automation logic and control flow
- UI feedback and user control
